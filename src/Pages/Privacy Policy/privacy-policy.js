                    <p>The information we collect includes: </p>

                        <li><strong>Device Data.</strong> We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services.

                        <li><strong>Location Data.</strong> We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services. </li>
